Building Real-Time Applications with Java Spring Boot and WebSocket
Real-time applications are those that require immediate response and 
interaction with the users and they can often involve data updates or 
notifications without requiring the page refresh. Java Spring Boot along 
with the WebSocket can provide a powerful framework for building such applications.
WebSocket is the communication channel over a single TCP connection, and it can enable real-time, 
bidirectional communication between the client and the server.
WebSocket can allow both the client and server to initiate communication at any time and also enable
instant data exchange without the need for continuous pooling or long-lived connections.

Prerequisites:
Basic Knowledge of Java
Familiarity with Spring Boot
